# XCTemplate

A skeleton project for an iOS app. Clone and copy to get an Xcode project up quickly with sensible build settings, structured file layout, placeholder assets and more.

Comes with several utility scripts to automate setting up the project, switching between live/beta builds, etc.

Meant to be used with Xcode 4.6 or 5.0 DP.


## Features

- Stricter warnings: Every reasonable compiler warning is enabled.
- Layout: Opinionated file layout for better project organization.
- Issues target: Run this to enumerate all issue tags (TODO, FIXME, etc) from within Xcode.
- Setup script: Edit config.sh and run setup.sh to quickly configure the project template.
- Env script: Quickly switch between live and beta build files and assets.
- Header script: Prepend a license or other header text to every source file.
- Img script: Generate placeholder assets or compose beta assets from existing ones.

## Known Issues

There isn't much in the way of sanity checking so be sure to apply any configurations before starting to work with the project.
